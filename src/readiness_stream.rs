/// object is readable or writable. Once the methods return that an object is
/// readable/writable, then it will continue to do so until the `need_read` or

/// It's the responsibility of the wrapper to inform the readiness stream when a
/// "would block" I/O event is seen. The readiness stream will then take care of
/// any scheduling necessary to get notified when the event is ready again.
