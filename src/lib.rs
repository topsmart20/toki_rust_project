//! A binding to mio giving it a future/stream interface on top.
//!
//! This library contains the rudimentary bindings to an event loop in mio which
//! provides future and stream-based abstractions of all the underlying I/O
//! objects that mio provides internally.
//!
//! Currently very much a work in progress, and breakage should be expected!
