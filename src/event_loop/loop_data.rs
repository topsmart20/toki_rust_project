/// sendable across threads. This is then in turn used to build up the
/// `LoopData` abstraction above.
///
/// A `DropBox` currently contains two major components, an identification of
/// the thread that it originated from as well as the data itself. Right now the
/// data is stored in a `Box` as we'll transition between it and `Box<MyDrop>`,
/// but this is perhaps optimizable.
///
/// The `DropBox<A>` itself only provides a few safe methods, all of which are
/// safe to call from any thread. Access to the underlying data is only granted
/// if we're on the right thread, and otherwise the methods don't access the
/// data itself.
///
/// Finally, one crucial piece, if the data is dropped it may run code that
/// assumes it's on the original thread. For this reason we have to be sure that
/// the data is only dropped on the originating thread itself. It's currently
/// the job of the outer `LoopData` to ensure that a `DropBox` is dropped on the
/// right thread, so we don't attempt to perform any communication in this
/// `Drop` implementation. Instead, if a `DropBox` is dropped on the wrong
/// thread, it simply leaks its contents.
///
/// All that's really just a lot of words in an attempt to justify the `unsafe`
/// impl of `Send` below. The idea is that the data is only ever accessed on the
/// originating thread, even during `Drop`.
///
/// Note that this is a private module to have a visibility boundary around the
/// unsafe internals. Although there's not any unsafe blocks here, the code
/// itself is quite unsafe as it has to make sure that the data is dropped in
/// the right place, if ever.
