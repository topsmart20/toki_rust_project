//! A module for working with "easy" types to interact with other parts of
//! tokio-core.
//!
//! This module contains a number of concrete implementations of various
//! abstractions in tokio-core. The contents of this module are not necessarily
//! production ready but are intended to allow projects to get off the ground
//! quickly while also showing off sample implementations of these traits.
//!
//! Currently this module primarily contains `EasyFramed`, a struct which
//! implements the `FramedIo` trait in `tokio_core::io`. This structure allows
//! simply defining a parser (via the `Parse` trait) and a serializer (via the
//! `Serialize` trait) and transforming a stream of bytes into a stream of
//! frames. Additionally the `Parse` trait passes an `EasyBuf`, another type
//! here, which primarily supports `drain_to`, to extract bytes without copying
//! them.
//!
//! For more information see the `EasyFramed` and `EasyBuf` types.
